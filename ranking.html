			<h3>White Belt</h3>
			<p>White belt is the beginning rank for all Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu students. White belt is the lowest ranking belt within Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It is the rank held by any practitioner new to the art and has no prerequisite. Some instructors and other high-level practitioners feel that white belt is the rank where most of the student training emphasis should be placed on escaping and defensive positioning, as it can be argued that a white belt will do much of his or her fighting from inferior positions.</p>
			<h3>Blue Belt</h3>
			<p>A general estimate of the time required to obtain a blue belt in most academies is 1 to 2 years. Blue belt is the second lowest adult rank within the most commonly accepted Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grading system, bridging the way between the beginner rank of white belt and the intermediate rank of purple belt. The IBJJF requires that a practitioner be at least 16 years old to receive a blue belt (thereby officially entering into the adult belt system)</p>
			<h3>Purple Belt</h3>
			<p>A general estimate of the time required to progress from blue belt to purple belt in most academies is 2 to 3 years. It is often considered one of the longer held ranks, and typically takes at least 3 years of dedicated training to achieve. The purple belt level practitioner holds a formidable amount of knowledge, and purple belts are generally considered qualified to instruct lower belts. In other martial arts, students with a similar amount of time and effort invested would often be ranked as a black (instructor) level belt.</p>
			<h3>Brown Belt</h3>
			<p>Brown belt is arguably the beginning of the elite ranks in and of itself, typically taking at least 5 years of dedicated training to achieve. As a transitional rank, it is often thought of as a time for refining rather than accumulation, where a practitioner has already acquired technical and practical skills until they reach a black belt level</p>
			<h3>Black Belt</h3>
			<p>The black belt is the highest common belt within the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, denoting an expert level of technical and practical skill. Estimates vary on the time required to achieve the rank, with 10 years total (or more) an often heard estimate</p>
			<h3>Black and Red Belt</h3>
			<p>Current IBJJF regulations places the time it takes to progress from a 6th degree black belt to 7th degree black-and-red belt at 7 years. When a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt reaches the 7th and 8th degree, the practitioner is awarded an alternating red-and-black belt (similar to the alternating red and white belt earned at the 6th degree in Judo).</p>
